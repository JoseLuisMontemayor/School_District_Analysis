# School_District_Analysis

### Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data of an School District regarding grades, funding, total students and other data regarding math and reading subjects. Based on raw data, thanks to the Jupyter Notebook tool, we were able to conduct our analysis to get to our final conclusions, taking also into account that there had been a case of academic dishonesty and data had been altered. We conducted a series of analysis regarding the requests and cleaned up data to run the correct scenarios for visualization. 

## Results

Due to an academic dishonesty regarding the ninth grade students of Thomas High School, we had to conduct the analysis again replacing their scores with an NaN. After replacing for the correct information, the total results that we obtained were the next:

After seeing this results and comparing them with the original ones we could notice a couple of interesting points for the whole district:
  * The overall passing percentage regarding math declined to 75%
  * The overall passing percentage regarding reading decline to 86%
  * And evidently the overall passing rate fell to 65%
  * The overall pass

Replacing the data for the ninth grade students of this High School has notable and significant results, we can also see that regarding the overall passing percentage is one of the worst High Schools in the district, falling brutally from the top 5 places in which it was before.

The last image shows the results for all the district high schools, and there a couple of notable results for Thomas High School:
  * The overall passing percentage regarding math declined to 67%
  * The overall passing percentage regarding reading declined to 70%
  * And evidently the overall passing rate fell to 65%


### Results by School Spending

It is shown that averages and passing percentages do not increase as the spending per student increase, there would be no correlation in terms of increasement of funds. The highest overall passing percentage is the one that has less funding per student with 90.4%, and the one with most funding has an overall passing percentage of 53.5%.

### Results by School Size

Another interesting result, is that the small and medium schools have the best results. Only Holden and Pena High Schools are classified as small, meanhile most of the other schools are between meduim and large. It is impressive how the large schools have an overall passing rate so far from the other options (more than 30%). It would be engaging to see the development after an action plan.


### Results by School Type

The average math and reading scores from the Charter and District Schools are not so differenciated, what caughts attention is the overall percentage of passing, where in the District Schools have a terrible ratio of a 54%, in the other hand with the Charter Schools that have a passing percentage of 90%.

## Summary

In terms of the made changes of the scores interfaced as NaNs, it is evident that the disrict overall, reading and math scores declined, also the passing percentage for their students. Before, Thomas High Schools was one of the best schools in the list, which now came to the last places as in contrast. It also affected the results as a school size and school type, since the scores of a whole grade were not considered for this exercise.
