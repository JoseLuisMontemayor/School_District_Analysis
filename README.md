# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the project

The purpose of this project is to analyze data of an School District regarding grades, funding, total students and other data regarding math and reading subjects. Based on raw data, thanks to the Jupyter Notebook tool, we were able to conduct our analysis to get to our final conclusions, taking also into account that there had been a case of academic dishonesty and data had been altered. We conducted a series of analysis regarding the requests and cleaned up data to run the correct scenarios for visualization.
